# Setting up a machine

One toolchain, pinned by `flake.nix`, on every platform. Install Nix,
clone, run `just test`. This page is the per-platform part of that.
Nix is the only supported way to build; every `just` recipe enters the
flake itself, so nothing else is installed by hand.

Use the [Determinate Nix installer](https://determinate.systems/nix-installer/)
everywhere: one command, flakes on by default, a clean uninstall, the
same Nix on Linux, macOS and WSL.

## Linux (x86_64 or aarch64)

```
curl -fsSL https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

Open a new shell, then:

```
git clone git@github.com:ProjectCartograph/cartograph-ui.git
cd cartograph-ui
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
just test
```

The first `just` evaluates the flake and fetches the pinned toolchain
(Node, just, Chromium),
a few minutes once, seconds after. Optional: `direnv` with
`direnv allow`, so the shell is already inside the flake and recipes
skip the second of start-up.

Docker is needed only for `just image` (loading the flake-built image)
and `compose.yaml`; `just release` builds the binaries without it.

## macOS (Apple silicon or Intel)

```
curl -fsSL https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

Open a new terminal, then the same clone and `just test` as on Linux.

Chromium is not packaged for macOS in nixpkgs, so the flake leaves it
out there. PDF printing and the browser flows then use whatever browser
you point `CHROMIUM` at:

```
export CHROMIUM="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"
```

Everything else (the gate, `just ci`, `just release`) runs the same.
Container images are Linux root filesystems; build them on Linux or in
CI, or run `just image` inside a Linux VM.

Optional, recommended for a machine you keep: [nix-darwin](https://github.com/nix-darwin/nix-darwin)
manages the macOS system itself (shells, services, the Nix daemon's
settings) from a flake, the way NixOS does on Linux. Determinate's
installer and nix-darwin work together; follow nix-darwin's README
with the "Determinate" option. It is not required to build Cartograph.

## Windows (WSL2)

Nix does not run on Windows itself; it runs in WSL2, which is a Linux
machine. Everything below happens inside it.

1. In PowerShell as administrator: `wsl --install` (Ubuntu by default),
   restart, open Ubuntu from the Start menu and create your user.
2. Inside Ubuntu, follow the Linux steps above, including the
   Determinate installer.
3. Clone into the Linux filesystem (`~/git/...`), never under `/mnt/c`:
   file watching, permissions and speed are all wrong across that
   boundary.
4. Editor: VS Code with the "WSL" extension opens the WSL folder
   directly; JetBrains IDEs have the same.
5. Docker, if you want `just image`: Docker Desktop with the WSL
   integration turned on for your distribution.

Line endings: Git for Windows may convert them; inside WSL use the Linux
Git (`git` from Ubuntu), and leave `core.autocrlf` unset.

## Verify

```
just ci
```

Green here is green in CI: the same flake, on both architectures.

## Without Nix

Not supported. The recipes refuse to run without it, on purpose: a build
with whatever Go or Node was on the PATH is a different build, and the
point of the flake is that there is only one. `CARTOGRAPH_TOOLCHAIN=1`
makes the recipes run with your own tools anyway, and you own the
result.
